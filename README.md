# Hi, I'm Daynen 👋

I’m a junior developer focused on **DevOps, automation, scalability, and cloud**.  
I like building practical systems: from custom web apps to small infrastructure labs with CI/CD, containers, and monitoring.

---

## 🔭 What I’m working on

- **Phone Skin Designer** – A full-stack tool that lets users:
  - Select a phone model
  - Upload and position artwork on SVG templates
  - Generate production-ready assets for printing and cutting  
  _Focus:_ reliability of the design → generate → produce pipeline, plus room to add CI/CD and cloud deployment.

- **DevOps Lab (in progress)** – A playground repo for:
  - CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
  - Containerization experiments with Docker
  - Basic monitoring/logging setups
  - “Break it, then fix it” reliability practice

- **Automation & Utility Scripts** – Small Python/JavaScript tools to:
  - Speed up repetitive tasks
  - Clean up data
  - Support my personal projects and phone-skin business

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

**Languages**
- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript

**Web & Backend**
- React
- Node.js / Express
- HTML / CSS

**DevOps & Infra (learning & using)**
- Git & GitHub
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker (intro level)
- Linux & terminal workflows
- Cloud fundamentals (AWS/Azure/GCP basics – ongoing)

**Other**
- Jupyter / Notebooks
- VS Code
- E-commerce tooling for my phone-skin brand

---

## 🌱 What I’m learning next

- Deeper **cloud** knowledge (networking, IAM, storage, compute)
- Production-minded **CI/CD** patterns
- **Observability** basics: logs, metrics, and alerts
- Designing small services that are easier to deploy, scale, and maintain

---

## 📌 How I think

- I like treating projects as **systems**, not just code:
  - How is it deployed?
  - How do we know it’s working?
  - What happens when it breaks?
- I care about:
  - Clear structure and readable code
  - Automation over repetition
  - Iterating in small, safe steps
